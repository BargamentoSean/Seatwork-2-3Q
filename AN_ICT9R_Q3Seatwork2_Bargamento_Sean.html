				<p>Directors: Anthony Russo, Joe Russo</p>
				<p>Release: April 24, 2019 (Philippines)</p>
				Sypnosis:<br>
				Adrift in space with no food or water, Tony Stark sends a message to Pepper Potts as his oxygen supply starts to dwindle. Meanwhile, the remaining Avengers -- Thor, Black Widow, Captain America and Bruce Banner -- must figure out a way to bring back their vanquished allies for an epic showdown with Thanos -- the evil demigod who decimated the planet and the universe.
				<br>
				Review:<br>
				As I said before, I've haven't watched too many movies, I am not a fan of them. However, Avengers: Endgame was one of the last movies I watched and I can say with pure confidence it is indeed a good movie. And don't take my word for it, there are billions of people who loved this movie too, and its because its a satisfying conclusion to all the previous movies has built up to. It makes you proud that you were in this journey with the MCU, and once it's over, you feel satisfied with the whole series. Perfect conlusion to the Infinity Arc.

				<p>Directors: Vicky Jenson, Andrew Adamson</p>
				<p>Release: August 22, 2001 (Philippines)</p>
				Sypnosis:<br>
				Once upon a time, in a far away swamp, there lived an ogre named Shrek whose precious solitude is suddenly shattered by an invasion of annoying fairy tale characters. They were all banished from their kingdom by the evil Lord Farquaad. Determined to save their home -- not to mention his -- Shrek cuts a deal with Farquaad and sets out to rescue Princess Fiona to be Farquaad's bride. Rescuing the Princess may be small compared to her deep, dark secret.
				<br>
				Review:<br>
				It is a childhood classic. I've watched this show a few times in the past (and once more a year ago) and it never fails to give me enjoyment. I could say more, but we get what I am meaning; a good movie overall.

				<h2>#3: Toy Story 4</h2>

				<p>Directors VJosh Cooley</p>
				<p>Release: June 20, 2019 (Philippines)</p>
				Sypnosis:<br>
				Woody, Buzz Lightyear and the rest of the gang embark on a road trip with Bonnie and a new toy named Forky. The adventurous journey turns into an unexpected reunion as Woody's slight detour leads him to his long-lost friend Bo Peep. As Woody and Bo discuss the old days, they soon start to realize that they're worlds apart when it comes to what they want from life as a toy.
				<br>
				Review:<br>
				Well, guess who watched Toy Story again? I've only watched it once, but although I didn't feel much, it's pretty dope. I'd recommend watching the other Toy Story's before this, but if you've already done it... Yep, I think you'll be alright here.
